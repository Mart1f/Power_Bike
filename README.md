# 🚴‍♂️ Power Bike – Energy-Generating Bicycle System

This repository contains the complete source code and system description for an **interactive energy-generating bicycle** that monitors, transmits, and visualizes real-time electrical parameters such as **RPM, voltage, current, and power output**.

---

## 🔧 System Overview

The project integrates multiple hardware components, including:

- 🧠 **Raspberry Pi 4** – acts as the main display unit
- 📡 **Two ESP32 microcontrollers** – for sensor reading and control logic
- ⚙️ **Dynamo** – generates electricity as the user pedals
- 💡 **120V LED strips** – visually indicate energy production via relays

---

## 🔁 How It Works

1. As the user **pedals**, the **dynamo** generates electricity.
2. A dedicated **ESP32**:
   - Reads raw sensor data (RPM, voltage, current).
   - Scales and processes the values.
   - Sends the data via **Bluetooth** to the **Raspberry Pi 4**.
   - Simultaneously **broadcasts** the power data over **Wi-Fi** (MAC-based protocol) to a second ESP32.
3. The **Raspberry Pi 4**:
   - Receives the data via Bluetooth.
   - Displays real-time metrics on a connected screen using a **Python GUI (Tkinter)** dashboard.
4. The **second ESP32**:
   - Receives power data over Wi-Fi.
   - Controls **relay modules** to turn on/off high-voltage **LED strips**.
   - The number of LEDs turned on increases with the pedaling effort and power output.
